// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.



var names = ["Hassan" , "Waqar" ,  "Ehsan" , "Aurangzaib"]
for (var i of names) {

    console.log(`${i} ,` + 'Good Morning! Have a nice day')
};
